      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This site was created as a frontend to
        <a href="https://github.com/glisignoli/fcreplay">fcreplay</a>. Submissions are now disabled.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Why are some thumbnails/videos missing?</h3>
      <p>
        If the video was recently added, then it is probably still processing.
        Check back in a little while.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is it taking so long for my video to encode?</h3>
      <p>
        Provide there are no encoding jobs running, your replay will take at
        least as long as the replay length to encode. Eg: A 1 hour game of kof98
        will take at least 1 hour to encode.
      </p>
      <h3>Why isn't my game supported</h3>
      <p>
        If you wish to add a new game then please add a pull request to
        <a href="https://github.com/glisignoli/fcreplay">fcreplay</a> containing
        the rom name and game name.
      </p>
      <h3>Why doesn't X support character detection?</h3>
      <p>
        At the moment, character detection is done by using fbneo detectors. To
        add more support, add new detectors to
        <a href="https://github.com/JordiRos/fightcade-detectors"
          >fightcade-detectors</a
        >
